# reactjs-fundamentals
> The front-end of the transaction management application, GoFinances.

ðŸš€ This project is based on the goStack ReactJS challenge of fundamentals with TypeScript, exploring my knowledge of exporting data from a local api, historing all the data and importing a CSV file.

It was to implement the front-end of an transaction management application, training what I have learned so far in ReactJS with TypeScript.

Made with ðŸ’œ by **me**.
